## Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

- Pleased to struggle with the following topics:
  - Build sufficient knowledge and intuition behind recent workhorse macroeconomic models, such as **heterogeneous agents models**, **monetary policy** transmission mechanisms, **intercations** between fiscal and monetary policy, **hhs' balance sheets**, and **CB's communication**and **expectations**.
  - **The Evolution of EU+ Banking Networks,** Centrality and Systemic Risk: 2006â€“2022 -- I need to update this manuscript, it has some solid insights about the heterogeneity inside Euro Area.
  - **Energy Transition, Competitiveness and Growth:** RVAR Evidence from Greece & Belgium (2025) -- Just submitted this one! Have a look, always in its pre-print version - always happy to receive negative feedback! **DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5528698**
